# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Prediction-Get-Cure-App

I developed this APP using Deep learning. As Farmer, I know Farmer can’t solve Farm’s complex and even small problems due to lack of perfect education. So as AI enthusiastic I decided to solve this problem using the latest technology like AI.



I just took baby step and start to collect lots of images of cotton crop plants from my farm. To collect accurate data we need expertise in that domain and as a farmer it help me a lot.

Then I decide which algorithm is best to solve this problem and I select as usual you know “Convolution Neural Network” (CNN). I create my own CNN architecture and it works well on the training and as well as testing dataset.

It gives me more than 98% accuracy on training and validation data set in just 500 epochs. I am trying to increase accuracy with more data and epochs.

## Tools / IDE
I used Jupyter NoteBook (Google Colab) for model training. used pycharm for model deployment on the local system.
